# Packlunch the Jetpack replacement
Nvidia TX2 replacement for Jetpack installer. Bash scritp for remote install and setup of Nvidia Jetson TX2 cards with additional kernel build and debootstrap options for minimal install.

# Setup
There is a minimal requirement for the host system to support the bash scripting environment and have the apt-get package manager. For missing dependancies the script will attempt to install the required packages.
